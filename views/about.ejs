        <br />
    
        <div>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Curse’m is a lighthearted Halloween-themed app that invites users to “curse” someone in a fun, playful manner! Simply enter the name of someone you'd like to curse and share your humorous reasoning.

            </p>
            
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                For users, Curse’m is designed to be entertaining—perfect for a quick giggle among friends or to share some Halloween spirit. For those who know me personally, it’s all about creating laughter and lighthearted moments.

            <h2>Development Goals</h2>
            <p>
                From a technical standpoint, Curse’m served as my reintroduction to using Express routers and working with user data to dynamically render webpages through EJS components. I built this app from scratch to enhance my understanding of backend routing and templating while revisiting CSS to create a responsive, visually appealing user interface.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Matthew, and as I write this in October 2024, I reflect on my programming journey over the last four years. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Middle Tennessee State University, intending to pursue a master’s degree in social work or quantitative psychology. After briefly moving to San Francisco post-graduation, I became intrigued by software engineering after conversing with several individuals in the tech community.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This newfound interest led me to enroll in App Academy, a computer programming bootcamp, which I completed in 2021. Although my initial experiences did not unfold as I had hoped, I learned valuable lessons that shaped my approach to programming and my understanding of what’s important to me in a software engineering role.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Between 2022 and early 2024, I focused on other aspects of life and coded only sporadically. However, in mid-2024, I purchased a MacBook Air, reigniting my passion for coding. I now dedicate significant time to relearning technologies I previously worked with and exploring new ones to broaden my skill set. My primary objective is not only to refresh my past knowledge but also to cultivate self-reliance in seeking out resources and understanding documentation, which has deepened my comprehension of various technologies.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I am excited about the journey ahead and welcome any opportunities to collaborate on projects or connect with others in the software development community!
