# Curse'm

Description
Curse’m is a lighthearted Halloween-themed app that invites users to “curse” someone in a fun, playful manner! Simply enter the name of someone you'd like to curse and share your humorous reasoning. Whether you're looking to get a laugh among friends or just want to add some spooky fun, this app is made for you!

Purpose
For users, Curse’m is designed to be entertaining—perfect for a quick giggle among friends or to share some Halloween spirit. For those who know me personally, it’s all about creating laughter and lighthearted moments.

Development Goals
From a technical standpoint, Curse’m served as my reintroduction to using Express routers and working with user data to dynamically render webpages through EJS components. I built this app from scratch to enhance my understanding of backend routing and templating while revisiting CSS to create a responsive, visually appealing user interface.

Features
* User-Friendly Input: Easily submit a name and curse details.
* Dynamic Rendering: Enjoy a fun, interactive user experience with real-time updates.
* Clean, Responsive Design: A simple yet elegant UI that works across devices.
